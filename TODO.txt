Fix memory leak in 'SerialWidget::initOptionsWidget()' in file: 'serial_widget.cpp'

Add configurable limits for ServoBoard Max and Min values (ie. adjustable range) ex: 0-97
	-Factor out constants to a single file

* added when there are no servos selected on store.

Factor out maps for PWMRepeat and SequenceRepeat to have one map for all classes.

Don't lose entered data(checkboxes, servo positions) when switching tabs.

Allow for changes to text to be automatically included without asking.

Away to set the global sequence delay and repeat.

Make advanced options popup cleaner.

Add a way to drag and drop in SER and SERVO files to have them open over what is there.

Add an automatic updater to grab updates from a server.

Make a real style sheet for all the pages, add images to the play button ect. 

ADAM QUESTIONABLE DESIGN CHOICES

I have the file dialogs being created in the controller, not the view for servoboard_main, which breaks MVC a little bit.

Got rid of position inheriting QObject, it didn't need any of the function, and a copy constructor is great for such a small class.
